C++ Data Types

All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. 
Therefore, we can say that data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store.
 Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data-type with which it is declared. 
Every data type requires a different amount of memory.

1)Primitive Data Types:
     These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. 
     example: int, char , float, bool etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are: 
        *Integer
        *Character
        *Boolean
        *Floating Point
        *Double Floating Point
        *Valueless or Void
        *Wide Character

2)Derived Data Types:
    The data-types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types.
    These can be of four types namely: 
        *Function
        *Array
        *Pointer
        *Reference

3)Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: 
    These data types are defined by user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. 
    C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes: 
         *Class
         *Structure
         *Union
         *Enumeration


Integer: Keyword used for integer data types is int.
         Integers typically requires 4 bytes of memory space and ranges from -2147483648 to 2147483647. 
 
Character: Character data type is used for storing characters.
           Keyword used for character data type is char. 
           Characters typically requires 1 byte of memory space and ranges from -128 to 127 or 0 to 255. 
 
Boolean: Boolean data type is used for storing boolean or logical values. 
         A boolean variable can store either true or false. 
         Keyword used for boolean data type is bool. 
 
Floating Point: Floating Point data type is used for storing single precision floating point values or decimal values. 
                Keyword used for floating point data type is float. 
                Float variables typically requires 4 byte of memory space. 
 
Double Floating Point: Double Floating Point data type is used for storing double precision floating point values or decimal values. 
                       Keyword used for double floating point data type is double. 
                       Double variables typically requires 8 byte of memory space. 

EXAMPLE:

 // C++ program to sizes of data types
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    cout << "Size of char : " << sizeof(char)
      << " byte" << endl;
    cout << "Size of int : " << sizeof(int)
      << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of short int : " << sizeof(short int)
      << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of long int : " << sizeof(long int)
       << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of signed long int : " << sizeof(signed long int)
       << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of unsigned long int : " << sizeof(unsigned long int)
       << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of float : " << sizeof(float)
       << " bytes" <<endl;
    cout << "Size of double : " << sizeof(double)
       << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of wchar_t : " << sizeof(wchar_t)
       << " bytes" <<endl;
     
    return 0;
}  


Output: 
 

Size of char : 1 byte
Size of int : 4 bytes
Size of short int : 2 bytes
Size of long int : 8 bytes
Size of signed long int : 8 bytes
Size of unsigned long int : 8 bytes
Size of float : 4 bytes
Size of double : 8 bytes
Size of wchar_t : 4 bytes
